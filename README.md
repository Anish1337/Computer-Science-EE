# Computer Science EE 
* As part of the high school IB Diploma program, students were requied to choose a topic to research and write about. I chose to write a 3655 word analysis on activation functions in convolutional neural networks as part of my IB Diploma. While difficult, I learned a lot abot python, tensorflow, and the basics of CNN's. 

### Research Question: 
> To what extent can certain activation functions produce more accurate predictions of handwritten digits in a convolutional neural network?

### Format
* The final EE is posted as a pdf in this repository, the code can no longer/tensorflow experiments cannot be found, but screenshots were included in the appendix section of the EE.
