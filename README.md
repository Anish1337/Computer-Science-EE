# Computer Science EE 
* As part of our high school IB Diploma program in 2019, students were requied to choose a topic to research and write about. 
* I chose to write a 25-page, 3655-word analysis on activation functions in convolutional neural networks. 
* While difficult, I learned a lot abot python, tensorflow, and the basics of CNN's. 

### Research Question: 
> To what extent can certain activation functions produce more accurate predictions of handwritten digits in a convolutional neural network?

### Format
* The final EE is posted as a pdf in this repository, the code/tensorflow experiments no longer exist, but screenshots were included in the appendix section.
